        <h2>About the owner</h2>

        <p>
            “After spending my whole life on motorcycles, finishing my degree in mechanical engineering 
            and working for two large companies making motorcycles I decided to change my priorities in life. 
            I’ve never been good at sitting in an office waiting for Friday to come so, decided to start being 
            self-employed. While I started off with engineering projects for companies in the motorcycle 
            industry, I also began to make notes and write down ideas for the motorcycle I would make myself. 
            I soon felt that my excitement wasn’t going to get any less and decided to explore the road of what 
            has now become Vicious!”
